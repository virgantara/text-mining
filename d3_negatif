Finished watching the film about an hour ago and have to say this. It is the most underwhelming of all marvel movies. Even when the lead actress is showing off her power(which no villain in the movie even comes close to matching), you feel absolutely nothing. I am a big Marvel fan and super hyped for Endgame.

But this movie only justifies its ticket because of the two end-of-credits scene. Nothing else is memorable
