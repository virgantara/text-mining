Weeding out the very obvious social justice messaging here, which comes off as cliche any more, we have another overproduced, predictable, superficial cartoon masquerading as something more than it really is. The craftsmanship is there in terms of acting, production, audio mixing, etc. but strip all of that away and there just isn't anything all that interesting to see. Want to immerse yourself in a feminist super-hero universe with depth, range, and meaning? Skip Captain Marvel and binge the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series.
