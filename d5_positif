I know people have been getting criticism on this movie, but no matter what this is a key movie on whats going to happen in Avengers Endgame. It is cool to see Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson reunite again and being in the 90s reminds me of being a kid again cause I was born in 1992 and it was my era of movies. Marvel has a big year ahead with this film and Avengers Endgame, this will be a grand finale you'll never forget. Plus Spider-Man far fron home in july will be very exciting to watch
